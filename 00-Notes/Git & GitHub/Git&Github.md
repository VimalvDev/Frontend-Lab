## What is Git and GitHub? Are they the same?

### Git
  - A **version control system (VCS)** that tracks changes in our code and files.
  - Helps us **manage project history** and **collaborate** without losing previous work.
  - Works **locally on our computer**.

### GitHub
  - A **cloud platform** to store our Git repositories **online**.
  - Makes it easy to **share code, collaborate**, and contribute to open-source projects.
  - Provides **issues, pull requests, and project management** tools.

### **Are they the same?**
  - **No.** Git is the **tool**; GitHub is a **platform that uses Git**.
  - We can use Git **without GitHub**, but GitHub makes sharing and collaboration easier.

### **Why use them?**
  - Keep **backup and history** of our projects.
  - Easily **revert to previous versions** if something breaks.
  - Work **with teams** on the same project without conflicts.
  - Showcase our projects **publicly on GitHub**.

- **Pull**:
  - Fetch and merge the latest changes from the **remote repository** to your local machine.

- **Branch**:
  - A separate line of development to **work on new features without affecting the main code.**
  - Default branch is usually called **`main` or `master`.**

- **Merge**:
  - Combine changes from one branch into another (often used to merge a feature branch into `main`).
