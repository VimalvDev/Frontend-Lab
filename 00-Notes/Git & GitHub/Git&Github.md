## What is Git and GitHub? Are they the same?

### Git
  - A **version control system (VCS)** that tracks changes in our code and files.
  - Helps us **manage project history** and **collaborate** without losing previous work.
  - Works **locally on our computer**.

### GitHub
  - A **cloud platform** to store our Git repositories **online**.
  - Makes it easy to **share code, collaborate**, and contribute to open-source projects.
  - Provides **issues, pull requests, and project management** tools.

### **Are they the same?**
  - **No.** Git is the **tool**; GitHub is a **platform that uses Git**.
  - We can use Git **without GitHub**, but GitHub makes sharing and collaboration easier.

### **Why use them?**
  - Keep **backup and history** of our projects.
  - Easily **revert to previous versions** if something breaks.
  - Work **with teams** on the same project without conflicts.
  - Showcase our projects **publicly on GitHub**.

## Process: Creating a Repo and Uploading on GitHub

### 1. Create a local repo and type command to start Git tracking in our folder:
Open your terminal, go to your project folder, and type:
```bash
git init
```

### 2. Add files:
```bash
git add .
```

### 3. Commit changes:
```bash
git commit -m "initial commitJ"
```
### 4. Create a repo on GitHub and copy **repo URL**

### 5. Connect our local repo to Github:
```bash
git remote add origin <repo-url>
```
### 6. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git push -u origin main
