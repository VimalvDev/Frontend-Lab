## What is Git and GitHub? Are they the same?

### Git
  - A **version control system (VCS)** that tracks changes in our code and files.
  - Helps us **manage project history** and **collaborate** without losing previous work.
  - Works **locally on our computer**.

### GitHub
  - A **cloud platform** to store our Git repositories **online**.
  - Makes it easy to **share code, collaborate**, and contribute to open-source projects.
  - Provides **issues, pull requests, and project management** tools.

### **Are they the same?**
  - **No.** Git is the **tool**; GitHub is a **platform that uses Git**.
  - We can use Git **without GitHub**, but GitHub makes sharing and collaboration easier.

### **Why use them?**
  - Keep **backup and history** of our projects.
  - Easily **revert to previous versions** if something breaks.
  - Work **with teams** on the same project without conflicts.
  - Showcase our projects **publicly on GitHub**.

## Git & GitHub: Key Terminologies

- **Repository (Repo):** A project folder tracked by Git, storing our code and its version history.
- **Commit:** Saving your changes with a short message.
- **Clone:** Copy a GitHub (remote) repo to our local machine.
- **Push:** Upload our saved changes (commits) to GitHub.
- **Pull:** Download changes from GitHub to our computer.
- **Branch:** A copy of your project to add new features without breaking your main project.
- **Merge:** Combine changes from one branch into another.
- **Fork:** Create a personal copy of someone else’s repo on our GitHub.
- **Pull Request (PR):** A request to merge our changes into the main repo (used in collaboration).
- **Remote:** The URL of our online repo usually named `origin`.

- `git clone <repo-url>` → Copy a remote repo from GitHub to your computer.
- `git remote add origin <repo-url>` → Connect your local repo to GitHub.
- `git remote -v` → Check connected GitHub repo URLs (remotes).
- `git add filename` or `git add .` → Get a specific file or all files ready to save in Git.
- `git commit -m "commit message"` → Save your changes with a descriptive message.
- `git status` → Check which files have been changed and are ready/not ready to save.
- `git log` → Show commit history.
- `git log --oneline` → Show commit history but in short.
- `git checkout -b branchname` → Create and switch to a new branch.
- `git checkout main` → Switch to the `main` branch.
- `git branch` → List all branches in your repo.
- `git merge branchname` → Merge another branch into your current branch.
- `git branch -d branchname` → Delete a branch (after merging).
- `git push -u origin main` → Upload (push) your commits to GitHub for the first time.
- `git push` → Upload commits to GitHub after the first push.
- `git pull origin main` → Download and merge the latest changes from GitHub into your local repo.

## Process: Creating a Repo and Uploading on GitHub

### 1. Create a local repo and type command to start Git tracking in our folder:
Open your terminal, go to your project folder, and type:
```bash
git init
```

### 2. Add files:
```bash
git add .
```

### 3. Commit changes:
```bash
git commit -m "initial commitJ"
```
### 4. Create a repo on GitHub and copy **repo URL**

### 5. Connect our local repo to Github:
```bash
git remote add origin <repo-url>
```
### 6. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### 7. Future changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push
```

## 🚫 Using `.gitignore` to Ignore Files in Git

### 📌 What is `.gitignore`?

`.gitignore` is a **special file where you list files and folders that you don’t want Git to track or push to GitHub.**  
This helps keep your repo clean and secure.

### 🚀 Why use `.gitignore`?

✅ Avoid pushing:
- Secret files (e.g., `.env` with passwords).  
- Large folders (e.g., `node_modules`, `dist`).  
- OS or editor-specific files (e.g., `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`).

### 🛠️ How to create and use `.gitignore`
- 1. Create a file named `.gitignore` in your project folder.
- 2. Add the files or folders you want Git to ignore, for example:
```
node_modules/
.env
dist/
*.log
```
