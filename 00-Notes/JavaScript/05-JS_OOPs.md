# 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript

## 📘 OOPs and Prototype-Based Programming
![OOPs IMG]()

### 🔹 Class
- A **class** is a template or blueprint that defines **data members** (attributes) and **member functions** (methods).
- It doesn’t hold the data itself but serves as a structure for creating objects.

### 🔹 Objects / Instances
- Multiple **objects** are created from the class, each having the same structure.
- Each object is a unique instance of the class and can also have **additional attributes** individually.

### 🔹 Modification in an Instance
- An instance (e.g., `object1`) can be modified separately.
- This shows that **JavaScript objects are flexible** — changes to one instance won’t affect the class definition.

## 🧬 Prototype-Based Programming

- In JavaScript, **almost everything has a prototype** when dealing with objects.
- A **prototype** is like a built-in template that provides extra properties or methods to objects, arrays, functions, etc.
- JavaScript is **not a classical OOP language** like Java or C++, but it still supports OOP concepts like inheritance and object creation.

### ✅ Prototype Analogy
> If you make a cake (object), it follows a recipe (prototype).  
> If you add a new feature (like berries), you update the recipe (prototype), and all future cakes can have berries.

## 👨‍🏭 Constructors in JavaScript

Constructors are used to **create and initialize objects**. JavaScript supports two types:

### 1️⃣ Function-Based Constructor (ES5)

> Older way of creating constructor functions before ES6.

```js
function makeHuman(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

let ans = new makeHuman("Suraj", 19);
console.log(ans);
